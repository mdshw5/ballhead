    <p>This software program detects chromosomal abnormalities in parent-child trio-based microarray data. It has been shown to provide improved sensitivity for abnormality detection, with substantial improvement in detection of low-level mosaic abnormalities, as described in <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/14/367/">Joseph D. Baugher, Benjamin D. Baugher, Matthew D. Shirley, and Jonathan Pevsner. Sensitive and specific detection of mosaic chromosomal abnormalities using the Parent-of-Origin-based Detection (POD) method.
